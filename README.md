# PositionBasedDynamics

## Introduction

[PositionBasedDynamics](https://github.com/BFU-Graphics/PositionBasedDynamics) is a basic simulation framework to facilitate developing [" Position Based Dynamics "](https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf) based projects from scratch.

1. [PositionBasedDynamics](https://github.com/BFU-Graphics/PositionBasedDynamics) need no external dependencies but self-contained [libigl](https://github.com/libigl/libigl), which is a simple C++ geometry processing library, and would be automacally included once build.
2. [PositionBasedDynamics](https://github.com/BFU-Graphics/PositionBasedDynamics)  seperates utterlly the rendering part and the simulation part while developing.
3. [PositionBasedDynamics](https://github.com/BFU-Graphics/PositionBasedDynamics)  is deadly simple, and easy to understand and redevelop.

## Build Instruction

**For all platform: **

1. Clone [PositionBasedDynamics](https://github.com/BFU-Graphics/PositionBasedDynamics), or simply download this repo.
2. cmake, and build
